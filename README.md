The all in one Backend + Gameserver for Fortnite written in C++

The backend is essentially a port of [LawinServerV2](https://github.com/Lawin0129/LawinServerV2) from NodeJS to C++, while the gameserver is custom and has significant changes from other servers.  
You can control the backend and the gameserver from a central control panel GUI
